# Zenon Network Twitter Repository

## Overview
This repository, a fork of the official [zenon-network/twitter](https://github.com/zenon-network/twitter), is an innovative experiment designed to streamline the content creation workflow for the Zenon community's contributions to the [@Zenon_Network](https://twitter.com/Zenon_Network) Twitter feed. It's a collaborative effort that empowers community members to actively participate in shaping the voice and presence of Zenon on Twitter.

## How It Works
The process is divided into three main steps:

### Step 1: Create a Discussion
**Discussions**: We value neutrality and diversity in our editorial line. To suggest and promote tweet ideas, we utilize the GitHub Discussions' upvote feature. This democratic approach allows anyone to propose content for tweets. As our brand guidelines evolve, we'll refine our content to ensure it aligns with Zenon's voice and tone.

### Step 2: Submit a Tweet Proposal
**Issues**: Once a discussion gains substantial community support, an issue detailing the tweet's specifics will be created. We've streamlined this process with a custom Issue form to facilitate community contributions. Each issue is automatically added to the 'Draft Phase' of our [Twitter Feed Project](https://github.com/users/coinselor/projects/1).

### Step 3: Creating a PR for the Tweet
**Review Phase**: Once an issue is thoroughly detailed and ready for publication, it moves to the Review Phase. Here, a pull request is created following the Twitter-together syntax. Once ready, it's merged back into the main [zenon-network/twitter](https://github.com/zenon-network/twitter) repository, making the tweet ready for publication by Zenon's repository maintainers.

If you are familiar with GitHub, especially the [twitter-together GitHub action and syntax](https://github.com/twitter-together/action), you are encouraged to create a pull request for the tweet.

- **Branch Naming Convention**: Please use the naming convention `issue-[issue_number]` for your branch. For example, if you are addressing issue number 9, name your branch `issue-9`.
